• Implementation of the Apriori Algorithm: The Apriori algorithm can be effectively implemented to identify consumer purchase patterns based on transaction data from PT. Tuju Nata Persada between January 1, 2023, and June 30, 2023, totaling 2733 transactions. By applying a minimum support of 0.01 (1%), a minimum confidence of 0.2 (20%), and a minimum lift value of 5, 26 association rules were generated. For example, if a consumer purchases PAC112J and CORT CM15R, there is an 83.33% chance that they will also buy NUX MG300. The remaining 25 association rules can be used as references for promotional strategies such as bundling products, as all rules are supported by strong data with lift values greater than 1. These rules can also aid in managing surplus inventory by aligning them with desired promotional strategies.

• Data Preparation: During the data preparation phase, it was necessary to clean the data by excluding transactions with fewer than 2 products purchased. This resulted in a reduction of transaction data from 2733 to 1263 instances. The cleaned data produced association rules of significantly better quality.

•Web Application Implementation: The deployment of the Apriori algorithm via a web application developed using PYTHON and the FLASK framework facilitates user access to and utilization of the model for identifying consumer purchase patterns
